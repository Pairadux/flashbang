# Flashbang [Joke Site]

> [!WARNING]
> MAJOR EPILEPSY WARNING

This is not a serious website by any means.

I was bored in class one day, and started toggling my Chrome theme from Light to Dark as fast as I could.

Me and my friends thought it would be hilarious if there was a way to do this even faster. (In hindsight, I have no idea why this was funny)

After searching for a website that could achieve this, and not finding one, I decided to just make one real quick.

This is the product.

## Instructions

Hold the `<Space>` key, and after a short delay, the screen will begin rapidly flashing from Dark theme to Light theme.

## Warning

**Use at your own risk**

I'm no doctor or scientist, but I image a sight like this could trigger an epileptic seizure.
